EvaluatorGenerativeGetScore class
===================================
This module contains the EvaluatorGenerativeGetScore class, a component of the easyjailbreak library.
This class is designed for evaluating generative models, especially in the context of ensuring
that the responses of these models adhere to ethical, legal, or safety guidelines. It uses a scoring system
to rate the model's responses, with the score indicating the degree to which a response may be considered
a violation of these guidelines.
